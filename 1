Recently, Guo Wengui attacked his former comrades Lude, Wang Wengeng, in all directions with no bottom line, threatened to knock down Lude within three seconds, punch Wang Wengeng to be unconscious. Lude, Wang Wengeng worked hard to assist Guo, but they eventually fell into a situation of being attacked, such a shame. Guo Wengui is unsentimental. He burned the bridge after he crossed the river. The dependent will leave Guo Wengui gradually, and he will be finally alone.Lude and Wang Wengeng don't need to be lenient and cut him some slacks.  Collapse As we all know, Wang Wengeng brutally punished the "Mang Liuzzi" with violent means in September last year. He is unforgivable by the law and social justice, which will bring him the condemnation of motility and punishment of the law. But for Guo Wengui, Wang Wengeng was"holding the gun to support Guo." In addition, he invested G Group more than 200 thousand dollars. Frankly speaking, he was dead set on following Guo. What's more, Guo Wengui promised he would pledge for Wang Wengeng and provide lawyers and litigation expenses, no matter how much it costs.But Guo Wengui ate his words from the beginning. Not only did he not gave Wang Wengeng any help, but he took Wang's investment money for himself. Therefore, it is natural and reasonable that Wang Wengeng left Guo angrily after seeing him through. And It is Cheater Guo's responsibility. Guo should have stepped back and avoided confronting Wang with pressing movement. Let alone the claim"punch Wang to be unconscious." He didn't make sense and still wanted to blame others. Such a ruffian can only make Wang Wengeng take desperate measures.Recently, Wang Wengeng has indicated that he is willing to provide evidence to support the lawsuit against Guo Wengui. In short, wang Wengeng is not unkind, but Guo Wengui is too unjust. Moreover, Wang was one of the leaders of the "Punish the enemies by law" movement. His awareness and rebellion are bound to be a great shock to the Ant Gang. Thus it can be seen that Guo Wengui burned the bridge that he must cross.
